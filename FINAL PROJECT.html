    Kizomba is a genre of dance and a musical genre that originated in Angola in the late 1970's.In Kimbundu, a Bantu language spoken in Angola, Kizomba means "party" and it is a couple dance 
    characterized by a slower, romantic and more sensuous rhythm. The leader guides the follower across the dance floor with the goal of synchronizing perfectly as a couple with the music and express 
    it through elegant footwork, smooth body movement and attitude called <em>Ginga</em> for women and <em>Banga</em> for men. The musical genre emerged as a fusion of Semba, Angolan Merengue,Kilapanga and other Angolan music influences. Most Kizombas songs are sung in Portuguese or 
    a dialect from the various Portuguese speaking African cultures i.e Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique etc.Kizomba has gained popularity in the Western World for some years now and you can easily find Kizomba festivals taking place in the US, Spain, France,Portugal and some Eastern countries.

    <h2>
        How did I find out about Kizomba?
    </h2>
    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
        I like to think that Kizomba found me ðŸ˜Š. I had moved accross the country to a new city where I had no family, friends or acquaintances.
        Taking up a new activity was a way for me to not only meet new people but also try my hand at something challenging; Learning Kizomba 
        was definitely not a walk in a park for me. I thought being familiar with Zouk would have been an advantage in learning this new dance although I had never heard of Kizomba.
        The allure of the dance spiked my interest and its sensuality kept me addicted. 
        I have been dancing Kizomba for seven years now and althgouh I am not a professional, I dearly cherish the friendships I have weaved throughout the countless festivals I have attended.
        I went from not knowing anybody in this new city to having a group of friends that share the same passion.
        In a way, Kizomba gave me a new lease on life &#128521. Azembora!!!
